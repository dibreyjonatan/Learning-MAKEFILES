# UNDERSTANDING OBJECTS IN MAKEFILE

## What is an Objects in Makefile ?

An object file is a file that contains machine code or bytecode, as well as other data and metadata, generated by a compiler or assembler from source code.

## The Importance of Objects
### Seperation of Concerns 
- You compile each source file into an object file first `(.c --> .o )`.
- You *link all the objects* files together to make the final binary(executable).
### Efficiency 
- Only compiled source files get recompiled.
- Speeds up build in large projects.
## Explanation of Make Terminologies
 - `%` represents the name of the file (the prefix) e.g *%.c*
 - $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(src))
   * $(src) : list of c files 
   * %.c : pattern to match in $(src)
   * %.o : pattern expected (pattern to replace)
   
*NB: $(var :suffix=replacement)=$(patsubst %suffix,%replacement,$(var))*

#### Code to create each object file per source file
```
%.o : %.c
 	gcc -c $^ -o $@
```
Creates an object for each c file present in the current directory.\
This is essential to avoid a target for every object to be created from a c file.
